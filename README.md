For this project, I analyzed information about 10,000 movies collected from "The Movie Database (TMDb)", including user ratings and revenue. 
This dataset has 10866 rows and 21 columns and I'll be investigating these to find answers to the questions below:

* Which movie release had the highest and lowest profit? 
* What year was the most profit made from movie releases?
* Is there a correlation between profit and budget?
* What genre has the most count?
